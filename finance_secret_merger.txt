2. ACQUISITION TIMELINE: Due diligence completes on March 15th. We aim to announce the merger publicly on April 1st.
3. REGULATORY RISK: There is a 40% chance the FTC will block this merger due to antitrust concerns in the Northeast region.
4. LAYOFF STRATEGY: Post-merger, we project a 15% reduction in workforce, specifically targeting redundant branch managers and IT support staff.

6. CODE NAME: The target company (Rival Bank) shall be referred to strictly as "Target Omega" in all non-encrypted emails.
7. STOCK BUYBACK: To prevent stock dilution, we will execute a $500M stock buyback program immediately following the announcement.

9. INTEGRATION COST: The estimated cost to merge IT systems (Mainframe migration) is $450M over 3 years.
